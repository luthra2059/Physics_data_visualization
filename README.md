A web representation of how to measure ionization potential of Mercury

## Theory

The potential needed to remove electrons from an atom is known as ionization potential. The ionization potential is measured using a vapor filled gas diode. When the anode of the gas filled diode is at a positive potential with respect to the cathode, electrons move across the tube from the cathode to the anode. As the plate potential is increased beyond a particular value the plate current increases much more rapidly than it does below that critical value. This potential is equal to the ionization potential of the gas. Using this concept determine the ionization potential of mercury using a gas filled diode.
